A significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as China and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. In addition, certain government and economic incentives which provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically or have local suppliers, may provide a greater benefit to our competitors, which could negatively impact our profitability. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established resources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of competing energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. In addition, decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.\\nRisks Related to Our Operations\\n</document>\\n\\n\\nRespond in Chain-of-Thought format:\\n- Begin with <think> for detailed reasoning\\n- Include a long descriptive summary\\n- End with a clearly labeled section: \"Final Summary:\" that gives a 1-2 sentence overall summary.\\n- End with a clearly labeled section:  \"Sentiment Score:\" from 0 (completely negative) to 10 (completely positive).\\nWrap everything in <answer> tags.\\n\\n\\n', 'options': {}, 'stream': False, 'images': []}'\n",
